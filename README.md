# mueditor
Online markdown text editor which allows users to send compiled markdown via email through email as pdf or docx. 


## Startup 
npm run dev

check package.json for details on the script if curious. 

## Update: 

To no surprise, I won't be updating this project anymore. 

HOWEVER, I'll be keeping this up to provide boilerplate code for anyone who wants to setup a node/express project utilizing react. 

If anything is implemented incorrectly, feel free to create an issue and I'll resolve it as soon as I can!
